Altcase Supplier Portal
Objective
To create a dedicated portal for Altcase suppliers of unlisted shares. The portal will enable two-way interactions:
1. Altcase Demand Posting - Suppliers can view demand from Altcase (generated from investor/IFA system) and submit quotes.

2. Supplier Sell Requests - Suppliers can initiate selling opportunities to Altcase by posting availability.

This ensures smoother deal flow, faster execution, and transparent supplier engagement.

Stakeholders
● Suppliers - External brokers/suppliers of unlisted shares.

● Altcase Admin - Internal Altcase team managing deals, approvals, and contracts.

● System Integrations - Investor/IFA system, Altcase inventory, SPA generation engine.

Key Use Cases
Altcase Demand → Supplier Quotes

2. Demand posted on Supplier Portal (share name, qty, expected price).

3. Supplier views demand and submits a quote:

○ Fulfillment Price

○ TAT (time to deliver)

○ Other remarks (optional)

4. Altcase Admin receives all supplier quotes in backend.

5. System recommends best deal (lowest price, fastest TAT, reliability score if available).[1]

6. Admin clicks BUY DEAL → SPA/Contract auto-generated → sent to supplier + stored in Altcase system.


Supplier Sell Request → Altcase Buy Decision
Flow:
1. Supplier has availability of shares and wants to sell.

2. Supplier logs into portal → Submits availability (share name, qty, price, validity).

3. Altcase Admin reviews incoming offers.

4. Admin decides to accept/bid → moves deal through approval process.

5. On acceptance, SPA/Contract generated and routed through Altcase books.
